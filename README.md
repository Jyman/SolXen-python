# Mine SolXen on Solana Devnet (python one-liner)

This is a one-liner **SolXen** Miner for Solana Devnet (only been tested on my Ubuntu machine). 

Feel free to test it on Mac or other platforms and submit the necessary fixes.


## Usage

Running it is as simple as executing this one-liner on your machine. Just don't forget to add your Ethereum address at the end of the command.

Note: You'll need to clone this repo and update the 'keypair_path' in solxen.py to reflect your computer's path, and then curl to your address in the command below.


```curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JozefJarosciak/SolXen-python/master/solxen.py | python3 - <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>```
